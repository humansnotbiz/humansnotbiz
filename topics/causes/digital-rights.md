## Privacy, surveillance, and AI harms

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Digital rights protect people’s freedoms and safety in online spaces, including privacy, freedom of expression, access to information, and protection from unlawful surveillance. As more of life moves online, governments and companies can collect large amounts of personal data, sometimes without meaningful consent or transparency.

AI systems can increase these risks through facial recognition, predictive policing, automated decision-making (for jobs, housing, or benefits), and the spread of synthetic media like deepfakes. Digital rights work often focuses on transparency, accountability, data protection, and ensuring technology respects human rights.
