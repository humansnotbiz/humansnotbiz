## Conflict and humanitarian crisis

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

The DRC has faced decades of conflict, especially in the eastern provinces, where armed groups, insecurity, and repeated displacement have created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. Millions of people have been forced from their homes, and many communities struggle to access food, healthcare, and safe shelter.

The crisis is intensified by weak infrastructure, limited protection for civilians, and ongoing regional instability, making humanitarian support and long-term recovery extremely difficult.
