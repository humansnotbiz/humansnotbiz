## Climate change and global warming

<h3 id="understand-climate">Understand</h3>

Climate change is driven mainly by greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial agriculture. It is already increasing extreme weather, heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires, while threatening food systems, biodiversity, and public health.

The impacts are unequal, with low-income communities and countries often facing the greatest risks despite contributing the least to emissions. Reducing emissions and supporting adaptation are both urgent priorities.

## Animal welfare

<h3 id="understand-animals">Understand</h3>

Animal welfare focuses on reducing suffering and improving the lives of animals used in farming, research, entertainment, and the pet trade, as well as protecting wildlife from exploitation and habitat loss.

Many animal welfare concerns are linked to industrial farming practices, weak enforcement of protections, illegal wildlife trade, and lack of access to veterinary care for animals in shelters or on the streets.
