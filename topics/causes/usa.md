## Immigration enforcement and ICE

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

The United States is experiencing intense debate and conflict over immigration policy, particularly related to the role and actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and broader federal immigration enforcement. The federal government has expanded interior enforcement with large-scale raids, deportations, and operations in major cities, often resisted by local leaders. Recent high-profile fatal shootings involving federal immigration agents, including incidents in Minneapolis, have fueled nationwide protests and scrutiny of enforcement tactics. 

Protests and demonstrations against ICE and immigration enforcement have taken place across multiple U.S. cities, with activists demanding accountability, reforms, and even the abolition of ICE. These actions reflect broader concerns about use of force, civil rights, and the treatment of migrants and communities affected by enforcement operations. 

Immigration courts and the administrative system are facing record backlogs, leaving millions of cases unresolved and creating long waits for asylum seekers, family reunification, and other immigration pathways.
