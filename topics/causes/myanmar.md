## Conflict and humanitarian crisis

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Since the 2021 military coup, Myanmar has faced escalating conflict, widespread displacement, and severe human rights violations. Fighting between the military and resistance groups has intensified across multiple regions, forcing civilians to flee and limiting access to food, healthcare, and safe shelter.

The crisis is compounded by restrictions on humanitarian access, attacks on civilian infrastructure, and growing needs among displaced communities, especially women, children, and ethnic minorities.
