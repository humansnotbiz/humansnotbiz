## Humanitarian crisis and displacement

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Venezuela is experiencing one of the largest humanitarian crises and displacement emergencies in the world. Years of economic collapse, hyperinflation, shortages of food, medicine, electricity and clean water have undermined basic living conditions for millions of people. Political instability, repression of opponents and weak rule of law continue to affect access to fundamental rights. As a result, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country, seeking safety and opportunity in neighboring states and beyond. Many of these migrants and refugees face dangerous journeys and precarious conditions in host communities. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
