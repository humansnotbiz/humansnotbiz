## Humanitarian crisis and displacement

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

After more than a decade of conflict, Syria remains in a severe humanitarian crisis. Millions of people have been displaced inside the country or forced to seek refuge abroad, while many communities face shortages of food, clean water, healthcare, and safe shelter.

The situation is worsened by economic collapse, damaged infrastructure, restricted humanitarian access in some areas, and ongoing insecurity. Vulnerable groups, including children, older people, and people with disabilities, are especially at risk.
