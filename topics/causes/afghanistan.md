## Women and girls’ rights

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Since 2021, Afghanistan has been governed by the Taliban, who have imposed nationwide restrictions on women and girls. These include bans on secondary and higher education, exclusion from most employment, and severe limits on movement and public life.

The dismantling of legal protections, combined with economic collapse and reduced international engagement, has created one of the most severe gender-based rights crises globally.
