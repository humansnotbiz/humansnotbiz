## Afghanistan

Practical ways to help — action-first, sourced, and safe.

### Do now (15–30 minutes) 
- Pick **one** support track: donate, volunteer, or share verified sources.
- If you share: include **one** link + **one** concrete action (donate/volunteer).
- Avoid unverified fundraisers and viral posts without primary sources.
 
### Donate safely
- Prefer organizations with **published reports**, **clear programs**, and **local operations**.
- Avoid: random crowdfunding links, crypto wallets, and unverifiable “urgent” appeals.

**Suggested (add links + notes):**
- (placeholder org) — healthcare
- (placeholder org) — food/nutrition
- (placeholder org) — children’s support
- (placeholder org) — legal aid / protection

### Support journalism (reputable, low-drama)
- Read and share reporting from sources with strong editorial standards.
- Share **context** (1 sentence) + **action** (1 link).

**Suggested:**
- (placeholder source)
- (placeholder source)

### Women & girls (practical support)
- Support programs focused on:
  - education access
  - maternal health
  - protection services
  - legal aid
- Be careful with language: focus on **civilian needs** and **rights-impact**, not partisan framing.

**Suggested:**
- (placeholder org) — education / learning support
- (placeholder org) — maternal and child health
