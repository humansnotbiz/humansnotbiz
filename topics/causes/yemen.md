## Humanitarian crisis and war

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Yemen has been engulfed in a devastating conflict since 2014, with widespread fighting, airstrikes, blockades and economic collapse leaving millions of people in urgent need. The war has destroyed infrastructure, disrupted food and fuel supplies, and severely limited access to healthcare, clean water and safe shelter. Yemen remains one of the world’s largest humanitarian emergencies, with widespread hunger and disease affecting civilians across the country.
