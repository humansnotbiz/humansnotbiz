## Human rights crisis and repression

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Iran is experiencing a severe human rights crisis driven by widespread repression of protests, arbitrary arrests, violent crackdowns by security forces, and systemic restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association. Recent nationwide demonstrations since late 2025 have been met with lethal force, with thousands killed and tens of thousands arrested amid economic hardship and rising living costs. Women human rights defenders, ethnic and religious minorities, and civilians including children have been targeted. Iran’s judiciary also carries out executions at high rates, and enforced disappearances, torture, and unfair trials are reported. The government continues to tightly control digital communication and civic space. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
