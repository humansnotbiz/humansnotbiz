## Humanitarian crisis and civilian protection

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Gaza is facing an extreme humanitarian crisis driven by large-scale violence, mass displacement, and severe disruption of essential services. Many people have limited access to safe shelter, food, clean water, medical care, and sanitation.

Humanitarian organizations continue to respond under difficult conditions, with urgent needs for civilian protection and sustained delivery of aid.
