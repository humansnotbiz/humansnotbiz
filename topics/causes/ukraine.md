## War and humanitarian crisis

<h3 id="understand">Understand</h3>

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has faced widespread destruction, civilian casualties, and mass displacement. Communities across the country have been affected by attacks on homes, energy systems, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure, leaving many people without reliable access to heating, electricity, clean water, and medical care.

Humanitarian needs remain high, especially for displaced families, older people, and those living near the front lines, while long-term recovery and reconstruction will take years.
