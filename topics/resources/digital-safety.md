# 🔐 Digital Safety

## Privacy basics

Privacy isn’t secrecy — it’s control.

Be aware of:
- Location data
- Metadata in photos and files
- Search history and browsing habits

Small changes can significantly reduce exposure.

## Account hardening

Most accounts aren’t lost through hacking — but through neglect.

Good practices:
- Use a password manager
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Secure recovery emails and backup codes

Boring security is effective security.

## Safer sharing

Visibility can help — or harm.

Before posting:
- Could this expose someone else?
- Does it add context or just outrage?
- Is sharing necessary?

Pause before posting. People matter more than reach.
