<h2 id="privacy-basics">Privacy basics</h2>

- Location data on your devices
- Metadata in photos, videos, and documents
- Search history and browsing habits
- App permissions and background tracking

<h2 id="account-hardening">Account hardening</h2>

Most accounts are not compromised through advanced hacking, but through more boring measurements like password reuse, weak passwords, or unsecured recovery options. Please make sure you:
- Use a password manager
- Enable two factor authentication wherever possible
- Secure recovery emails and backup codes
- Keep devices and apps up to date

<h2 id="safer-sharing">Safer sharing</h2>

Before posting or sharing:
- Could this expose someone else to harm?
- Does it provide context or just amplify outrage?
- Is the information verified?
- Is sharing necessary at all?
