## How to help

Helping looks different for everyone.

Consider:
- Time, money, or skills
- Local or remote involvement
- One-off actions vs sustained support

You don’t need to do everything.  
Do something that fits your life.

## Vetting organizations

Trust is built through clarity, not pressure.

Look for:
- Financial transparency
- Clear goals and measurable impact
- Local partnerships and track records

Red flags include:
- Emotional manipulation
- Urgency without detail
- Vague descriptions of impact

## Avoiding scams

Crises attract bad actors.

Be cautious of:
- Fundraisers without verification
- Recycled or contextless images
- Pressure to share immediately

Helping responsibly is still helping.
