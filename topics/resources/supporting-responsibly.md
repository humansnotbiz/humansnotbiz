# 🤝 Supporting Responsibly

<h2 id="vetting-organizations">Vetting organizations</h2>

When evaluating organizations, look for:
- Financial transparency and public reporting
- Clear goals and realistic descriptions of impact
- Local partnerships or on the ground presence
- A history of consistent work, not only crisis driven activity

Common red flags because situations of crisis can attract oportunists and bad actors:
- Emotional manipulation or guilt driven messaging
- Pressure to act immediately without details
- Vague or inflated claims of impact
- No clear information about leadership or structure
- Fundraisers without independent verification
- Recycled images or stories without context
- Organizations that cannot explain how funds are used
