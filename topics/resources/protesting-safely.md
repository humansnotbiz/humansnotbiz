<h2 id="protest-lifecycle">Protest lifecycle</h2>

### Before the protest
- Know your rights (they vary by country, see [Legal resources](#legal-resources))
- Plan exits, meeting points, and transportation
- Dress for safety, weather, and mobility. 
- Consider whether anonymity matters to you (for example, covering your face, limiting identifiable clothing or unnecessary personal data)


### During the protest
- Stay with people you trust
- Avoid escalating situations started by strangers
- Pay attention to crowd shifts and police movement
- Leave early if things feel unsafe

### After the protest
- Write down details while memories are fresh
- Know how to access legal support if needed
- Rest, hydrate, and recover
- Be considerate when sharing on social media, especially images of others

Some quick tips!
- Phones reveal location and identity
- Photos may expose others without consent
- If possible, consider leaving your (primary/main) device at home.
- Review and configure your messaging apps/social media (+backups)

<strong>💡 Tip! <a href="https://activistchecklist.org/protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActivistChecklist.org's Prepare for a Protest</a></strong> is again a very useful checklist-like resource for _"protecting yourself and your community [...] while protesting or attending any kind of action where arrest risk and surveillance is higher"_ (this include digital safety).
