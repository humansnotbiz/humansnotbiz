# 📚 Books & Media

This section is optional.

These books, films, and documentaries provide historical and structural context for understanding
how economic systems, colonial legacies, and power imbalances shape many modern crises.

This is **not a reading list you’re expected to agree with**.
It’s a set of perspectives commonly referenced in discussions about global harm.

Use what’s useful. Leave the rest.

## How to use this section

- Read critically, not devotionally
- Cross-reference claims
- Notice where authors disagree
- Be wary of oversimplification

Understanding systems helps explain patterns.
It doesn’t excuse harm — and it doesn’t replace individual responsibility.
