# Humans Not Biz

Hi there 👋  
Thank you for your interest in Humans Not Biz.

The website [www.humansnot.biz](https://www.humansnot.biz/) and this repository are a small, bottom up, people driven project focused on helping people, regardless of governments, parties, religions, or ideologies.

Below you will find simple instructions to make contributing as easy and painless as possible.

As of February 2026, this project is maintained by one person, who is, of course, subjective and limited in knowledge and perspective (no international relations, history, etc. background). That is exactly why collaboration matters here.

The goal is simple, at least in theory:

Make it easier for average people to understand a cause, identify who is affected, and figure out how to help in a way that is informed, responsible, and human.

No governments.  
No organizations controlling the narrative.  
No hidden agendas.

Again, **this is a collaborative, open source project.**

## What this project is

- A public, collaborative knowledge base about global causes
- Focused on people and real world impact
- Built to reduce confusion, misinformation, and performative activism
- Open to review, critique, and improvement

Each cause tries to answer:
- What is happening (including accountability, because with great power comes great responsibility)
- Who is affected
- How to get and stay informed
- How to act responsibly (time, money, energy)

---

## What this project is not

- A charity or NGO
- A fundraising platform
- A political party or ideological space
- A place for flame wars or social media style debates

Discussion is welcome, but the goal is helping people, not winning arguments. People are actually suffering. Egos can wait.

## How content is created

All content lives in this GitHub repository and is written in plain Markdown files.

The process is intentionally simple:

1. A cause or resource is added or updated  
2. Sources are linked (mandatory)
3. Content is reviewed by others (ideally approved by two people before publishing)  
4. Improvements happen over time  

Nothing here is considered final or absolute.

## AI usage disclaimer

AI tools were used as **assistive tools** during the creation of this project. This is temporarely, to get things started!

This includes:
- Drafting text
- Improving clarity and structure
- Language cleanup and rephrasing

Important:
- AI does not decide what is included
- AI does not choose sources
- AI does not replace human judgment

All content is reviewed, edited, and approved by humans, and remains open to public scrutiny and improvement.
If you spot errors, bias, or missing context, please contribute or open an issue.

## How you can contribute

You do not need to be a developer to help.

You can contribute by:
- Fixing typos or unclear wording
- Adding or improving sources
- Suggesting new causes or resources
- Pointing out errors or outdated information

PS: I’m currently thinking through additional contribution channels beyond GitHub. Thanks for your patience 😜
