        <p>Hello there! Feeling overwhelmed by the state of the world? <br> Untrustful of what you see, confused, or tired of the performative side of activism? <br> Me too.</p>

  <p>
    This is a small, people driven project about doing something real, together. <br>
    No governments. No organizations. No charities. No hidden agendas.
  </p>

  <p> You don’t need to do everything. Start by picking a cause below and see what you can realistically invest in: <br>
  <strong>⏰ If you have time ⏰</strong>
    → learn <em>and</em> teach: understand context, follow credible journalism, share and help others avoid misinformation
  <br>

  <strong>💰 If you have money 💰</strong>
    → donate carefully, only when it actually helps
  <br>

  <strong>⚡️ If you have energy ⚡️</strong>
    → show up, protest responsibly, know the risks
  </p>
  <p>
  Below, you’ll also find <a href="#resources">resources</a> to help inform and protect yourself along the way.
  Please take a moment to check them out.

  <p>
    This site aims to be as objective and practical as possible, but we are human, and that is not always easy. That’s why your help matters. <br>
    Donations are not needed for the current traffic or workload. What is needed is your knowledge, perspective, and attention. All content here is generated from the GitHub repository below and exists in the collaborative spirit of open source. Everything should be questioned, discussed, reviewed, and improved.
     <p>
    <p>💡 So besides supporting the causes themselves, you can help by improving content, adding sources, fixing errors, or suggesting updates. 💡 </p>
  </p>
    This site should, and will, not be influenced by governments, companies, organizations, or any entity with hidden agendas.
   Debate, including political, is welcome and limited to GitHub → this resource exists first and foremost to help people in need, regardless of the labels or categories others may try to impose.     </p>
